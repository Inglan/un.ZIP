# un.ZIP
### This extension blocks all domains ending in .ZIP

.ZIP TLDs (Domain names) were a bad idea.
You could write a message saying: See the attached attachment .zip, and it could automatically turn into a link to the attachment .zip website (Yes, attachment .zip is a Rick Roll, thanks white hats)
This extension is here to save the day (Or your computer, at least).
Whenever you visit a .ZIP website, it will simply block it, with a learn more and back to safety button.
It should not slow down your computer because it only injects code on .ZIP websites, does not have any background scripts, and does not track you at all
